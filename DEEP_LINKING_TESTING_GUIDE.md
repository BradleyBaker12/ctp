## üì± **Testing Different App States**

### **Foreground Testing**

```bash
1. Keep app open and visible
2. Click a test button in admin panel
3. Local notification appears at top
4. Tap notification ‚Üí should navigate immediately
```

### **Background Testing**

```bash
1. Minimize the app (don't close it)
2. Send notification via admin panel or Firebase console
3. Notification appears in notification tray
4. Tap notification ‚Üí app opens and navigates
```

### **Terminated State Testing**

```bash
1. Force close the app completely
2. Send notification via Firebase console
3. Tap notification ‚Üí app launches and navigates after initialization
```

## üîß **Firebase Console Testing**

### **Setup**:

1. Go to Firebase Console ‚Üí Your Project ‚Üí Cloud Messaging
2. Click "Send your first message"
3. Use these test configurations:

### **Test 1: New Offer Notification**

```json
Title: "New Offer on Your Vehicle"
Body: "John Doe made an offer of R150,000"

Additional Options ‚Üí Advanced Options ‚Üí Custom Data:
{
  "notificationType": "new_offer",
  "vehicleId": "test_vehicle_123",
  "offerId": "test_offer_456",
  "dealerId": "dealer_id_here"
}
```

### **Test 2: New Vehicle Notification**

```json
Title: "New Vehicle Available"
Body: "Check out the new Mercedes Actros"

Custom Data:
{
  "notificationType": "new_vehicle",
  "vehicleId": "test_vehicle_123"
}
```

### **Test 3: Inspection Reminder**

```json
Title: "Inspection Scheduled"
Body: "Your inspection is tomorrow at 10 AM"

Custom Data:
{
  "notificationType": "inspection_booked",
  "vehicleId": "test_vehicle_123",
  "offerId": "test_offer_456"
}
```

## üêõ **Debug Testing with Console Logs**

### **Enable Debug Logs**:

Open Chrome DevTools or device logs and watch for:

```bash
# When notification is received:
DEBUG: Handling notification tap with data: {notificationType: new_offer, ...}

# During navigation:
DEBUG: Navigation data - Type: new_offer, VehicleId: test_vehicle_123, OfferId: test_offer_456

# Specific navigation actions:
DEBUG: Navigating to vehicle: test_vehicle_123
DEBUG: Navigating to offer: test_offer_456
```

### **Error Debugging**:

```bash
# If navigation fails:
DEBUG: Error during navigation: [error_message]
DEBUG: Navigator context not available, storing for later

# If offer/vehicle not found:
DEBUG: Offer not found: test_offer_456
DEBUG: No authenticated user
```

## üß™ **Real-World Testing Scenarios**

### **Scenario 1: Complete Offer Flow**

```bash
1. Transporter uploads vehicle
2. Admin approves vehicle
3. Dealer makes offer ‚Üí Transporter gets "new_offer" notification
4. Tap notification ‚Üí Should go to offers page
5. Transporter accepts offer ‚Üí Dealer gets "offer_response" notification
6. Tap notification ‚Üí Should go to offers page
```

### **Scenario 2: Inspection Flow**

```bash
1. Offer is accepted
2. Dealer schedules inspection ‚Üí Transporter gets "inspection_booked"
3. Tap notification ‚Üí Should go to offer details
4. Day of inspection ‚Üí Both get "inspection_today_*" notifications
5. Tap notifications ‚Üí Should go to relevant offer details
```

### **Scenario 3: Vehicle Discovery**

```bash
1. Admin pushes vehicle live
2. Dealers get "new_vehicle" notification
3. Tap notification ‚Üí Should go to vehicle details page
4. Can then make offer from vehicle page
```

## üö® **Troubleshooting**

### **Navigation Not Working**:

1. Check console logs for error messages
2. Verify notification data contains required fields
3. Ensure user is authenticated
4. Check if app has proper navigation context

### **Notifications Not Appearing**:

1. Check device notification permissions
2. Verify FCM token is being generated
3. Test with local notification first
4. Check Firebase console for delivery status

### **Wrong Page Navigation**:

1. Verify notification `notificationType` field
2. Check if `vehicleId`/`offerId` values are correct
3. Ensure user has proper permissions for target page

## üîÑ **Continuous Testing During Development**

1. **After Code Changes**: Test at least 2-3 notification types
2. **Before Deployment**: Run full test suite on both Android/iOS
3. **User Acceptance**: Have real users test common scenarios
4. **Performance**: Monitor navigation speed and app responsiveness

This testing approach ensures your deep linking works reliably across all user scenarios! üöÄ
