# Deep Linking Test Implementation

## Overview

Test pages have been created to validate deep linking functionality with the notification system. The implementation includes:

1. **DeepLinkTestVehiclePage** - Displays when navigating to test vehicle IDs
2. **DeepLinkTestOfferPage** - Displays when navigating to test offer IDs
3. **Smart routing logic** - Detects test IDs and routes to test pages instead of querying the database

## Test Pages Created

### Vehicle Test Page (`deep_link_test_vehicle_page.dart`)

- **Purpose**: Validates vehicle-related deep linking
- **Test ID**: `test_vehicle_123`
- **Features**:
  - Success confirmation with vehicle ID display
  - Visual indicators showing deep linking worked
  - Navigation buttons to test further routing
  - Material Design UI with success animations

### Offer Test Page (`deep_link_test_offer_page.dart`)

- **Purpose**: Validates offer-related deep linking
- **Test ID**: `test_offer_456`
- **Features**:
  - Notification type-specific displays
  - Dynamic color coding based on notification type
  - Comprehensive test data display (offerId, vehicleId, notificationType)
  - Context-aware messaging for different notification types

## Smart Routing Logic

### How It Works

The `main.dart` file now includes intelligent routing that:

1. **Detects test IDs**:

   - Vehicle IDs starting with `test_vehicle_`
   - Offer IDs starting with `test_offer_`

2. **Routes to test pages**:

   - Bypasses database queries for test IDs
   - Navigates directly to test pages with success indicators
   - Preserves notification context (type, IDs, etc.)

3. **Falls back to normal routing**:
   - Real IDs still query the database normally
   - Production functionality remains unchanged

### Updated Navigation Functions

```dart
void _navigateToVehicle(BuildContext context, String vehicleId, String? notificationType) {
  // Detects test_vehicle_* and routes to test page
  if (vehicleId.startsWith('test_vehicle_')) {
    // Navigate to DeepLinkTestVehiclePage
  }
  // Normal routing for real vehicle IDs
}

Future<void> _navigateToOfferDetails(
    BuildContext context, String offerId, String? vehicleId, String? notificationType) {
  // Detects test_offer_* and routes to test page
  if (offerId.startsWith('test_offer_')) {
    // Navigate to DeepLinkTestOfferPage with notification context
  }
  // Normal routing for real offer IDs
}
```

## Testing Instructions

### 1. Using Admin Test Interface

1. Go to Admin â†’ Notification Test Page
2. Use the colored test buttons:
   - **Blue Button**: "Test New Offer" (creates offer notification)
   - **Green Button**: "Test New Vehicle" (creates vehicle notification)
   - **Orange Button**: "Test Inspection" (creates inspection notification)
   - **Purple Button**: "Test Sale Complete" (creates completion notification)

### 2. Expected Test Flow

1. **Tap test button** â†’ Notification sent with test IDs
2. **Tap notification** â†’ App opens and parses notification data
3. **Smart routing** â†’ Detects test ID and routes to test page
4. **Success display** â†’ Test page shows with:
   - âœ… Success confirmation
   - ðŸ“± Test data display (IDs, notification type)
   - ðŸŽ¨ Color-coded notification type indicators
   - ðŸ”„ Navigation test buttons

### 3. Debug Information

Monitor the debug console for:

```
DEBUG: Notification data received: {notificationType: new_offer, offerId: test_offer_456, vehicleId: test_vehicle_123}
DEBUG: Navigating to offer: test_offer_456
DEBUG: Detected test offer ID, navigating to test page
```

## Test Page Features

### Visual Confirmation

- **Success icons**: Green checkmarks confirm deep linking worked
- **Data display**: Shows all parsed notification data
- **Color coding**: Different colors for different notification types
- **Contextual messages**: Explains what each notification type means

### Notification Type Support

The offer test page supports all notification types:

- `new_offer` - Blue with money icon
- `offer_response` - Purple with reply icon
- `inspection_booked` - Orange with search icon
- `collection_booked` - Teal with shipping icon
- `sale_completion_*` - Green with celebration icon
- `invoice_payment_reminder` - Red with payment icon

### Navigation Testing

Both test pages include buttons to:

- Navigate to relevant sections (offers, vehicles)
- Return to home page
- Test the navigation system end-to-end

## Production Considerations

### Safety Features

- **Test ID isolation**: Only IDs starting with `test_*` route to test pages
- **Production preservation**: Real IDs continue normal database routing
- **Error handling**: Fallbacks ensure app stability
- **Debug logging**: Easy to identify test vs production flows

### Cleanup

Test pages are:

- Self-contained with no database dependencies
- Safe to leave in production (only accessible via test IDs)
- Clearly marked as test functionality
- Isolated from production data and logic

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"No notification received"**

   - Check FCM token in debug logs
   - Verify device is registered for notifications
   - Ensure app has notification permissions

2. **"Navigation not working"**

   - Check notification payload structure
   - Verify test IDs are in correct format
   - Monitor debug logs for parsing errors

3. **"Test page not showing"**
   - Confirm test ID format (`test_vehicle_*` or `test_offer_*`)
   - Check import statements in main.dart
   - Verify test page files exist

### Debug Commands

```bash
# Check notification payload
flutter logs | grep "DEBUG: Notification"

# Monitor navigation
flutter logs | grep "DEBUG: Navigating"

# Check for errors
flutter logs | grep "ERROR"
```

## Next Steps

### Ready for Production

The deep linking system is now:

- âœ… Fully implemented with test validation
- âœ… Safe for production deployment
- âœ… Backwards compatible with existing functionality
- âœ… Well-documented and debuggable

### Future Enhancements

- Add more notification types as needed
- Implement deep linking for other entity types
- Add analytics tracking for deep link usage
- Consider universal links for iOS deep linking
