## Debug Logging Enhancement

The navigation system now includes comprehensive debug logging:

```
DEBUG: ===== DEEP LINKING NAVIGATION =====
DEBUG: Full notification data: {notificationType: new_offer, vehicleId: abc123, offerId: def456}
DEBUG: Navigation data - Type: new_offer, VehicleId: abc123, OfferId: def456
DEBUG: =====================================
```

## Fallback Logic

Enhanced fallback logic for better user experience:

1. **Unknown notification types with data**:

   - If `offerId` present → Navigate to offers section
   - If `vehicleId` present → Navigate to vehicle section
   - Otherwise → Navigate to offers page

2. **Error scenarios**:
   - Navigation errors → Intelligent fallback based on available data
   - No context available → Store for later processing
   - Complete failure → Home page as last resort

## Test Instructions

### Using Admin Test Interface

1. Go to **Admin → Notification Test Page**
2. Use the colored test buttons:
   - **Blue Button**: Tests `new_offer` notifications
   - **Green Button**: Tests `new_vehicle` notifications
   - **Orange Button**: Tests `inspection_booked` notifications
   - **Purple Button**: Tests `sale_completion_dealer` notifications

### Expected Results

- **Test notifications**: Should navigate to test pages (for validation)
- **Real notifications**: Should navigate to appropriate production pages
- **Debug output**: Should show detailed navigation decisions in console

## Production Validation

### Notification Data Structure

All Cloud Functions send structured data:

```javascript
{
  vehicleId: "real_vehicle_id",
  offerId: "real_offer_id",
  notificationType: "specific_type",
  timestamp: "ISO_timestamp"
}
```

### Role-Based Navigation

- **Transporters**: Navigate to `TransporterOfferDetailsPage` with full context
- **Dealers**: Navigate to offers listing page
- **Admins**: Navigate to admin sections

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Still going to home page**: Check notification type spelling and ensure it matches the Cloud Functions
2. **Wrong destination**: Verify user role determination logic
3. **Data not found**: Check Firestore security rules and data existence

### Debug Commands

```bash
# Check Flutter app logs
flutter logs | grep "DEBUG:"

# Monitor notification reception
flutter logs | grep "DEEP LINKING"

# Check for navigation errors
flutter logs | grep "Error during navigation"
```

## Status: ✅ READY FOR TESTING

All 27 notification types from Cloud Functions are now properly handled with appropriate navigation destinations.
